## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, you will need to have **Node.js** and a local or cloud-based **MongoDB** instance.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/structaquiz-project.git
    cd structaquiz-project
    

### 2\. Backend Setup

Navigate to the server directory and install the necessary dependencies.

    cd server
    npm install
    

Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory and add the following environment variables. You will need to get your own keys from MongoDB Atlas and ImageKit.

    # MongoDB Connection String
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    
    # Server Port
    PORT=5000
    
    # ImageKit Credentials
    IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_imagekit_public_key
    IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_imagekit_private_key
    IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=your_imagekit_url_endpoint
    
    # Frontend URL (for CORS)
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
    

To start the backend server, run:

    npm run dev
    

The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3\. Frontend Setup

In a new terminal, navigate to the client directory and install its dependencies.

    cd client
    npm install
    

Create a `.env` file in the `/client` directory and add the following variables. You will need your own keys from Clerk and ImageKit.

    # The base URL for your backend server
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
    
    # Clerk Publishable Key
    VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
    
    # ImageKit Public Key (for client-side uploads)
    VITE_IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_imagekit_public_key
    

To start the frontend development server, run:

    npm run dev
    

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
